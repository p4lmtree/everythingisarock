  <h2>Everything is a Rock</h2>
  <p>The living is « being ».</p>
  <p>The living, plants, animals and by extension Humans, are beings that follow the life cycle of birth, existence and ultimately death. These beings, by their life cycle, are qualified as organic, or made of living matter that can eventually falter. Minerals, on the other hand, are deemed as inorganic matter, non living bundles of atoms.</p>
  <p>However, this timeframe that we set on the existence of rock is relative; they are virtually infinite for us whose lifespan is comparatively so short. It also conditions the way that we look at the elements composing our world. We cherish life because it is fleeting, yet because other things are so durable in time, or at least outlast us, we do not consider them treasurable or worth the right to qualify as beings.</p>
  <p>But the existence of Humans themselves comes from the « infinite » timeframe of minerals. The formation of life on Earth comes from the innate intelligence of matter, including but not limited to rocks. Time and history has proven that the misconception of timeframes will become our downfall (see climate change), and this includes the inevitability of accepting rocks as living beings too; can we repair the severed ties of understanding between the organic and the non organic to better understand both ourselves and our future? Or will the misconception around matter precipitate our own demise?</p>
