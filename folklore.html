        <h3>1. William John Thoms (16 November 1803 – 15 August 1885) was a British writer whose investigation of folklore and myth led to a later career of debunking longevity myths, where he was a pioneer demographer.</h3>

        <h3>Illustration. National Geographic photographer Tom Abercrombie (in glasses) and Bedouin guides look at a 2,177 kilogram (4,800 pound) iron meteorite found near Al-Hadidah, Saudi Arabia. Meteorites are always black, because the material burns as it enters Earth's atmosphere—any shiny or colorful meteorites have been polished. </h3>
